## Laravel CRUD: the right way

When we develop an web application, most of the tasks are CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Even though CRUD seems easy, but there are a lot of places we can improve.
This repository is a code demonstration for a YouTube video series. In this series I explained the Laravel best practices and the things that we, as a developer, should keep in mind while doing CRUD operations. Feel free to watch and leave your feedback.
